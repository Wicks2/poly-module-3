# Logical Gate Circom Circuit with ZK-SNARK Proof

This project aims to implement a logical gate circuit using the circom programming language and provide a Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge (ZK-SNARK) proof to demonstrate the knowledge of specific inputs that yield a particular output.

## Circuit Logic

The logical gate circuit has the following truth table:

```
A B X Y Q
0 0 0 1 1
0 1 0 0 0
1 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1
```

The goal is to prove that we know the inputs A (0) and B (1) that yield a 0 output (Q = 0).

## Steps Involved

To successfully complete the project, the following steps will be undertaken:

1. **Write a Correct Circuit Implementation**: Implement the logical gate circuit using the circom programming language.

2. **Compile the Circuit**: Compile the circuit to generate circuit intermediaries.

3. **Generate a ZK-SNARK Proof**: Generate a ZK-SNARK proof using the specified inputs A=0 and B=1.

4. **Deploy a Solidity Verifier Contract**: Deploy a solidity verifier contract on the Sepolia or Mumbai Testnet.

5. **Verify the Proof**: Call the `verifyProof()` method on the deployed verifier contract and assert that the output is true.

## Quick Start

To quickly get started, follow these steps:

1. Install all dependencies by running `npm i`.

2. Compile the circuit using the command: `npx hardhat circom`. This will generate the `out` directory with circuit intermediaries and the `MultiplierVerifier.sol` contract.

3. Prove and Deploy:
   - Run `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts`. This script performs the following tasks:
     - Deploys the `MultiplierVerifier.sol` contract.
     - Generates a proof from circuit intermediaries using `generateProof()`.
     - Generates calldata with `generateCallData()`.
     - Calls `verifyProof()` on the verifier contract with the calldata.


## Transaction

To deploy the project on the Mumbai Testnet, run the following command:

`npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network mumbai`

Check for the successful transaction and verify fulfillment in the Mumbai PolygonScan by searching with the provided contract address.
